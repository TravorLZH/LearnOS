Learning OS
=======
This repo will show every code I wrote in order to write my OS at [TravorOS Repository][1].

## Introduction of different folders

`common`: Library functions I made for simplifying codes
### OS in 16 bit real mode

`helloworld`: Some very basic boot sector program I made.

`memorydemo`: Some demos of reading disk and memory

`kerneltest`: This is a failed demonstration of loading assembly kernel.

### OS in 32 bit protected mode

`helloworld32`: basic 32 bit programs

`kerneltest32`: A successful demonstration of loading c kernel in 32-bit protected mode

##### Note

`kerneltest32` may be the last project I created in this repo. If you want to find more, check out [TravorOS](https://github.com/TravorLZH/TravorOS")
