# kerneltest32: The origin of TravorOS

These are the original files I created for loading C kernel from bootloader. I am really surprised on differences between the lines of code this folder has and the lines of code my current OS has.

| kerneltest32 | TravorOS v0.4 | TravorOS v0.4-r1 |
| :----------: | :-----------: | :--------------: |
| 281          | 1364          | 1637             |
